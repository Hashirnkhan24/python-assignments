# Simple To-Do List Application

## Problem Statement

You will create a command-line application that enables users to keep track of their tasks. The application should have the following features:

### Add Task

- Users can add a new task to their to-do list by entering a description of the task.

### View Tasks

- Users can view all the tasks currently in their to-do list.

### Delete Task

- Users can delete a task from their to-do list by specifying the task number.

## Functional Requirements

### Add Task

1. Prompt the user to enter a description of the task.
2. Add the task description to the to-do list.

### View Tasks

1. Display all the tasks in the to-do list with their respective task numbers.

### Delete Task

1. Prompt the user to enter the task number they want to delete.
2. Remove the specified task from the to-do list.

## Topics to Be Used in Assignment

- **Variables**: To store the list of tasks.
- **Lists**: To maintain the collection of tasks.
- **Functions**: To encapsulate the functionality of adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.
- **Input/Output**: How to get user input and show the user some output.
- **Loops**: To display the menu and process user choices.

- **Exception Handling**: To manage errors and invalid inputs gracefully.

## Constraints

- Ensure that invalid inputs are handled gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

## Submission (optional)
